# CS410 Final Project: Improved Media Content Search
University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Fall 2021  
Professor ChengXiang Zhai  
Team "Bae Area": Brayden Turner and Joshua Smith

## Installation
Improved Media (Music) Content Search (IMCS) runs via an interactive Jupyter Notebook supported by Python 3.7+. Download the LyricSearch.ipynb file and run the cells to import the necessary libraries, scrape lyric data from Genius, and load the model.

To only run queries without downloading the dataset and custom building a model, the simplified notebook can be used which presents a completed [Annoy](https://github.com/spotify/annoy) index and mapping/ data model which can be used to run sample queries. This also uses interactive ipywidgets for single queries. This simplified application uses [AppMode](https://github.com/oschuett/appmode), an easy-to-install open source Jupyter extension to run a notebook as a web application.

## Background
We’ve all tried to remember a song but all we have is a rough description of what the song is about or one line of a lyric we managed to catch. Many search tools for music and movies are limited to metadata such as titles, artist, actors, but not the general sentiment of lyrics and content. The goal is to return a ranked list of songs that fits the description or lyric given. This can also be extended to add tags to content like “Song from Super Bowl 40 Halftime” or “Rolling Stone top 10 movies list” to enhance descriptive search.
